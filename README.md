Learning Outcomes:
Preprocessing: This project helped us to understand about Machine Learning models and techniques. Through data preprocessing of the dataset, we understood techniques for handling null values, missing values, formatting columns according to our need, and encoding categorical features.
Model implementation: We also implemented different regression models which included Linear Regression and Ridge Regression. This helped in increasing our understanding of model selection and evaluation. We gained knowledge of Linear/Ridge regression models providing a basic foundation for understanding the relationship between independent and dependent variables. The project demonstrated the importance of data preparation for model performance and accuracy.
Evaluation and visualisation: Furthermore, the utilization of cross-validation taught us the importance for assessing models' generalisability. We also saved and loaded the best- performing model using pickle demonstrated practical steps for model deployment. We learnt machine learning workflows, from data preprocessing to model building and deployment, which covered the whole end-to-end process.
